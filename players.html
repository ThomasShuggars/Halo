  <div class="player">
    <h3>MattM0de</h3>
    <img src="mattmode.jpeg" alt="mattmode img" class="matt-image">
    <p>BIO: In league history Mattmode has to be considered one of the best of all time. During his career he has had a knack of knocking them down with cold blooded head shots. He was also a member of the most dominant Halo team ever in Team Scooby
      Doo. On another note MattMode must have been a boy scout as a child because he builds some great campfires and roasts a mean smore.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="player">
    <h3>RiceMode31 aka McRibWalker31</h3>
    <img src="danny.jpeg" alt="ricemode img" class="danny-image">
    <p>BIO: What MattMode lacks RiceMode has and that is team chemistry. With his immaculate callouts and his pristine flanks, you could make an argument for him being the greatest of all time. However, BEWARE the wrath of the McRib you may get "What
      a waste of my fucking time!".</p>
  </div>
  <div class="player">
    <h3>Shuggas</h3>
    <img src="shuggas.jpeg" alt="shuggas img" class="shuggs-image">
    <p>BIO: Shuggas would never be confused as being a great in league history. But when you need a man to slide in there for a double or triple hump to boost team morale, he's your guy. Droppin assists and grabing power weapons are probably his
      better attributes next to the double hump. His greatest accolade is being a member of the greatest team in Halo history Team Scooby Doo!</p>
  </div>
  <div class="player">
    <h3>mbathula aka BaShittla</h3>
    <img src="bathula.jpeg" alt="bathula img" class="bathula-image">
    <p>BIO: Nothing could describe Bathula better than consummate professional. Always cool under pressure Bathula is the ultimate team player. Bathula moves about the stage like a thief in the night it doesn't hurt that he has the invisibility all
      the time. Nothing could show his team player mentality more than the amount of times he has faced the wrath of McRib. I mean I'm not sure how anyone could be told they are "a waste of fucking time" that many times and still keep coming back for
      more.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="player">
    <h3>ShankdatA55 aka ShaShitty</h3>
    <img src="shank.jpeg" alt="shank img" class="shank-image">
    <p>BIO: If there was an award for the most epic meltdowns Shank would win this in a landslide. From "shoving someone's cock into their own dick" to "I.. I... I... just can't play with Tleaf he is such a terrible teammate WAAAAAAAAA!". Another
      great feature of Shanks game is grenading and or rocketing his teammates in the back followed by a "hehehehehehehehe". Its hard to pick out anything beneficial that this player does but he is a seasoned vet and that counts for something.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="player">
    <h3>TacoSupreme212 aka CheesyGorditaCrunch</h3>
    <img src="juan.jpeg" alt="taco img" class="juan-image">
    <p>BIO: Taco is a rookie that has showed great promise. Quickly picking up on strategy and teamwork. In his young career he has been known to throw a sticky or two into a teammates back. All future teammates of his should be on the lookout for
      the Cinco de Taco edition baby bjorne.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="player">
    <h3>McGriddleRunner</h3>
    <img src="gabe.jpeg" alt="mcgriddle img" class="gabe-image">
    <p>BIO: Not many can call themselves league champion but McGriddle is one of the few. There is no more accurate a player in Halo than McGriddle. With a deadly accurate shot and ruthless spartan charges McGriddle has a well-rounded game.</p>
  </div>
  <h2 class="combatants">Retired Combatants</h2>
  <div class="player">
    <h3>Tleaf</h3>
    <img src="tleaf.jpeg" alt="tleaf img" class="tleaf-image">
    <p>BIO: TLeaf is one of the original Halo league members. It was a very sad day when he announced his retirement. There is some speculation that his signing with the "Big Baller Brand" ultimately led to his ride off into the sunset. Tleaf will
      always be remembered as the heads-up assasin no one ever could beat this man on a quick draw you just hoped you saw him first. There are rumors that a press conference is scheduled for Fall 2020 for a big announcement from his camp.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="player">
    <h3>NickMode aka DickMode</h3>
    <img src="nick.jpeg" alt="nickmode img" class="nick-image">
    <p>BIO: NickModes career started back in the Halo CE days. A career that is long and short lived would be the best way to encapsulate NickModes career arc. Timing is everything and NickModes timing was unfortunate on his last return to action he
      was thwarted by the ShaShitty league strike. Rumors have spread that the announcement of Halo Infinite has stoked the flames for a return to the game.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="player">
    <h3>MarcusMeridius aka Sharticus</h3>
    <img src="marcus.jpeg" alt="sharticus img" class="shart-image">
    <p>BIO: Just like Shuggas and ShaShitty Sharticus was never mistaken for being a great player. The unfortunate event that changed his career was the 1v1 dumpfest put on him by Humpin 25-0. Sharticus was never the same after the events of that
      night but who would be? He will always be remembered for his great sound bites such as "BBBBBBBBeatstickkkkk!" or "Get Shit on you Shitty!" or "Shut your mouth spread your cheeks!".</p>
  </div>
  <div class="player">
    <h3>HumpinNDumpin aka HumpedOnNDumpedOn</h3>
    <img src="brett.jpeg" alt="humpin img" class="hump-image">
    <p>BIO: Humpin had far from a storied career but there were many highlights and many more lowlights. His biggest accomplishment was the 25-0 thrashing of Sharticus. But his Halo career conflicted with Bachelor rose cermonies and eventually the
      rose won
      out.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="player">
    <h3>Ziddy</h3>
    <img src="ziddy.jpeg" alt="ziddy img" class="ziddy-image">
    <p>BIO: Ziddy was the greatest Bronze 5 in history. At times he seemed baffled at what was going on in the game. He was so confused about his skill level that he challenged Shuggas to a 1v1. To say the least that 1v1 didn't go to well for him and
      he quickly ushered himself into the shadows of retirement.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="player">
    <h3>BTPManiac</h3>
    <img src="ed.jpeg" alt="btp img" class="ed-image">
    <p>BIO: BTPManiac the true Halo story. BTPManiacs Halo career showed bright and faded fast. Just as his career was taking off in Halo 2 and he was looking poised to become a great it all fell apart. The Beer, Tennis, and everyone knows the Pussy
      consumed him and he could never get his game back on track.</p>
